            <p>This was started since I came to Ann Arbor I found the only good place to get Acai was Amers. Although it was good it was not great and something I knew could be even better. I wanted a way to continue to eat smoothie bowls and have an even bigger variety. I began making them and after starting to make them I realized that there was no need to pay 10-15 dollars per small bowl and I could now customize it anyway I want</p>
